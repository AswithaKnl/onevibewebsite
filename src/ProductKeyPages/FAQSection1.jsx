      question: "What is a Product Key, and why is it necessary?",
      answer:
        "A Product Key is a unique code used to activate and verify the purchase of our application. It ensures that the software is genuine and legally acquired, preventing unauthorized use or piracy.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do I get my Product Key?",
      answer:
        "You can generate your Product Key by filling out the form on this page with accurate purchase and company information. Once all details are verified, your Product Key will be issued.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use one Product Key for multiple installations?",
      answer:
        "No, a Product Key is valid for a single deployment. For additional installations, you will need to purchase additional licenses.",
    },
    {
      question: "Are the Product Key and Purchase Code the same?",
      answer:
        "No, they are different. The Purchase Code is provided by CodeCanyon upon purchase, while the Product Key is generated by AppDevs. However, the Purchase Code is required to generate the Product Key.",
    },
    {
      question: "What happens if I lose my Product Key?",
      answer:
        "If you lose your Product Key, contact our support team with proof of purchase, and we will assist you in recovering it.",

    {
      question: "Will my application stop working if I donâ€™t activate it with a Product Key?",
      answer:
        "Yes, the application requires a valid Product Key for activation and operation. Without activation, certain features may be restricted or disabled.",
    },
    {
      question: "Does the Product Key feature protect against null scripts?",
      answer:
        "Yes, the Product Key ensures that only licensed users can activate the software, significantly reducing the risk of null scripts and unauthorized use.",
    },
    {
      question: "What should I do if my Product Key is not working?",
      answer:
        "Ensure that you have entered the correct details, including your purchase code and email. If the problem persists, contact our support team for assistance.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is my information secure during the Product Key generation process?",
      answer:
        "Yes, we prioritize your privacy and security. All submitted information is encrypted and used solely for generating your Product Key.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I transfer my Product Key to another domain or server?",
      answer:
        "Product Key transfers may be allowed under certain conditions. Please contact our support team for further guidance on this process.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need to regenerate a Product Key after updating the software?",
      answer:
        "No, updates to the software do not require a new Product Key unless the installation is moved to a new domain or server.",
    },
